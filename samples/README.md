# Sample SPFx Projects

This folder is intended for local SPFx test projects used to validate the SPFx Local Workbench extension during development.

Notes:
- Projects under `samples/` are excluded from VSIX packaging and VS Code search.
- For the most reliable detection and debugging, open a sample project folder directly in its own VS Code window (or Extension Host) when testing.
